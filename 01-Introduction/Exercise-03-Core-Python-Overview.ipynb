        "Welcome! In this fast-paced practice, you'll build a mini \"Dice Duel Tournament\" to review core Python concepts end-to-end. Write your own code in new code cells under each step.\n",

        "- What you'll practice:\n",
        "  - Scalars and expressions (ints, floats, bools), variables\n",
        "  - Core data structures (lists, tuples, sets, dicts)\n",
        "  - Control flow (`if/elif/else`)\n",
        "  - Loops (`for`, `while`) and comprehensions\n",
        "  - Functions (parameters, returns, docstrings, scope)\n",
        "  - Strings (formatting, slicing) and a touch of regex\n",
        "  - Errors and exception handling\n",
        "  - Iterators and generators (light)\n",
